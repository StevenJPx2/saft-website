          SAFT Apologetics made public appearance on June 1, 2019. The goal of
          SAFT Apologetics is captured in our title - 'Seeking Answers Finding
          Truth' and is derived off inspiration from late Nabeel Qureshi's
          autobiography. We seek to stir conversations about the most important
          questions of mankind. To seek answers honestly is of utmost priority.
          We believe that the God who revealed His invisible attributes in
          nature (Romans 1:20) is close to those who seek Him honestly (Acts
          17:27). The ultimate personification of truth was revealed in Christ
          and we believe that the honest seeker will encounter Truth- Christ
          Jesus.

          The initial area of ministry of SAFT was SAFT Podcast. Through SAFT
          Podcast we bring sound and relevant discussions about God and the case
          for belief in Him. We've featured some of the greatest defenders of
          Christianity like Dr William Lane Craig, Dr Frank Turek, Abdu Murray,
          Greg Koukl, J Warner Wallace and many others. Our speaking team also
          engages in making the case for Christianity beyond the podcasting
          platform by engaging with live audiences across languages.

        <div class="from-founder--text" aos>
          <p>
            Back in March (2019), right off the back of an adrenaline rush of
            the intellectually stimulating world of Christian apologetics, I
            shared the interest with my two close friends about starting a
            YouTube channel to present matters in the field of apologetics to
            netizens. Though it seemed out of the blue, it had been brewing in
            my heart for some time.
          </p>
          <p><b>Time for a flashback.</b></p>
          <p>
            My introduction to the field of apologetics took place right when I
            was a kid, albeit I didn’t know the first thing about apologia.
            There were questions about “how long did it take God to create the
            earth” and “whether God wrote our names in the Book of Life after we
            accepted Christ or even before our birth” (it was a couple of months
            ago that I recalled this and noticed that I had pondered about the
            highly debated topic of predestination!). My parents were all into
            honouring and hosting servants of the King and hence I had multiple
            instances where I sat at the feet of and listened to one of the
            maestros of Christian apologetics, erudite author, profound
            theologian, and expert orator Kerala has ever produced – Pastor K O
            Thomas. Since then debates and lectures on biblical topics would
            invigorate me into attending them.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as I said, I didn’t know what apologetics was nor how it helped
            further the cause of the Good News. Until late 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            My long- time mentor, friend, and spiritual father-figure Pastor
            Jerin Thomas (Canada) pitched the idea of cultivating a habit in
            reading, particularly in apologetics and theology to make my solo
            time in hostel productive. That’s when I decided to give apologetics
            a proper try. I began with getting my hands on McDowell classics
            like More than a carpenter and Evidence that demands a verdict and
            Lee Strobel’s The Case for Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there I was. Thrilled by the field of Christian apologetics.
            Satisfied with how it defended my faith. Wondering why I didn’t
            start early. Stunned by the plethora of resources out there. Excited
            to see the Amazon delivery agent soon. Thankful to God for
            introducing me at the right time.
          </p>
          <p><b>……And we’re back in.</b></p>
          <p>
            When I knew God was asking me to start a ministry (of sorts, at
            least that’s how I saw it back then) I asked him “Why me?”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christian apologetics, in my eyes, wasn’t a field that was in a
            severe dearth of organisations, speakers, history or resources. In
            fact, since the second century A.D apologists , like Justin Martyr,
            were prominent. So, God, I asked, what can I, someone who is new to
            the field, do? His response was a gem that I’ll cherish and impart
            for the rest of my life;
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am the gardener. Just be the plant. I’ll grow it. I know how
            everything will fit into the garden at the end.”
          </p>
          <p>
            So prayerfully with the support of my friends, I started SAFT
            Apologetics. We decided podcasts were the way to go ahead and SAFT
            Podcast was born. Down the line, as they had to part ways with SAFT,
            God sovereignly brought Ankit (you might know him as Piyush) into
            the team. Being from a missionary family that has been at the helm
            of advancing the gospel through India Campus Crusade for Christ in
            varied positions, the support and guidance Ankit brought were
            invaluable.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we carried on. Our trust was, since inception, placed in the One
            with whom there is no turning of shadows (James 1:17). We knew that
            the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), the One who
            called us will lead us to fruition, a truth best captured in the
            words of Hudson Taylor:
          </p>
          <p>“God's work done in God's way will never lack God's supply.”</p>
          <p>
            As we begin a new phase of our ministry, we invite you to join hands
            with us as we spearhead this mission for our God and Soli Deo
            Gloria; and we shout:
          </p>
          <p>‘Onwards to God!’</p>
          <p>
            In service of the King,<br />

          SAFT Apologetics from its very inception. I have known SAFT's Founder
          Jacob Varghese and his teammate Steven John for ten years from my ICPF
          days in UAE. It is a great joy for me to witness their growth and
          passion for punching holes in the darkness. Jacob is not only a
          strategic thinker; he is a practitioner in apologetics, a young man
          not only well-read but well-practiced. I pray that Jacob, Steven, and
          Ankit, through SAFT would equip both young and old to defend the truth
          of God’s word and reach the nations for His glory. I highly commend
          them to you.

          “And you will know the TRUTH and the TRUTH will make you free” John
          8:32 (NASB). The reality of this 21st century is that more than 50% of
          the World Population lives with a Postmodern mindset, which doesn’t
          believe, accept or, support the facts of Absolute Truths. This
          generation strongly adheres to the belief system based on radical
          reasoning, thus it raises the bar of need to present the Truth in a
          more appropriate and convincing way, helping one to respond to the
          TRUTH rather than reject/react to the facts of the TRUTH. I
          congratulate and affirm the “SAFT” Team for successfully completing

        <h1 class="mb-8">Statement of Faith</h1>
        <p>We believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth;</p>
        <p>
          And in Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, the Eternal
          Word manifested in the flesh, His only Son our Lord; who was conceived
          by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius
          Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried; the third day He rose from the
          dead;
        </p>
        <p>
          He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father
          Almighty; from there He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in the Holy Spirit who is the Third Person of the Godhead,
          the holy catholic church<sup>1</sup> , the communion of the saints,
          the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life
          everlasting<sup>2</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe the sixty–six books of the Old and New Testament Scripture
          alone to be verbally inspired by God and inerrant in the original
          text, and that they alone are of supreme and final authority in faith
          and life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died as a representative and
          substitutionary sacrifice for the sins of every human being and thus
          offers salvation as a free gift based on grace alone. We believe
          justification is a judicial act of God's grace wherein He acquits a
          person of all sin and accepts that person as righteous in His sight
          because of the imputed righteousness of Christ. Justification is
          strictly a work of God's grace, apprehended through faith alone, and
          solely on the account of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation. And since Christ
          has commissioned His people, the church, to go into all the world to
          disciple, to baptize, and to teach everyone everywhere to obey His
          Word, we desire, by His grace, to play our part in reaching the world
          with the Gospel of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe the Lord Jesus Christ will return to this earth,
          personally, bodily, and visibly to establish his glorious reign in a
          kingdom that will never end. As the sovereign Lord, He will resurrect
          and judge all humanity. Those who have received His offer of life
          through the Gospel will go to eternal blessings in heaven; those who
          have rejected it, to eternal conscious torment in hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          We look forward to the blessed hope, Christ's Second Coming in glory.
          Amen.
        </p>
